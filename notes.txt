------------------------
Approach (greedy)
------------------------
0) Create an empty array for moves and initialize a counter to zero for moveCount
1) Look at the monoblock (starting from top left)
2) For each color: 
    - Count how many cells of this color are adjacent to this block (directly or not): "colorables"
    - Take the color for which this count is max
3) Color all colorables. Keep track of the color in moves and increment moveCount.

Repeat

APIs
------------------------
One element = one "cell" with attributes x, y, color.
Data structure for the grid: a flat list of cells --> NOPE, a nested one.


------------------------
Learnings
------------------------
// nested arrays are better for later access
// BUT: mutability issue
// double check needed for both cells to exist
// check on small example: what are exactly the stop conditions
// beware when sorting on entries, take the right one (key or value)
// nested arrays and deep copies!!! must be repeated each time....
